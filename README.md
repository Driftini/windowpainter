# WindowPainter
An app for https://windows96.net to easily change the colors of the default theme.

## Installation
> **NOTE:** This app is still unfinished.
> It is a good idea to make a backup of your Windows96 installation before installing WindowPainter in its current state to avoid possible data loss, even though it would obviously be unintended and very unlikely.

First of all, download `src/wnd_main.html` and `src/wpaint.css` and upload both to `C:/local/wpaint` in Windows96.
Next, download `src/wpaint.js` and upload it to `C:/system/boot/apps`, then reload Windows96.

No shortcuts will be created automatically: you have to run WindowPainter as `wpaint` from either the Terminal or the Run prompt.

An easier to use temporary installer may be released to make the process easier for developers and interested users alike.
